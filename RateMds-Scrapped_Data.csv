22,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Was very thorough at the beginning of the appointment. When told him of my concerns, seemed to get argumentative. Argued that the test I was requesting would show ""symptoms"". Asked if possible if I was a carrier and some things can be asymptomatic. continued to argue then said would order the tests(clearly to appease me). Then rushed me out the door without giving me my scripts for the tests.  had to get the scripts from the secretary.  Went to get the blood work done and the requested tests weren't on it. contacted the office on Thursday, was told Dr. would call by end of day, had to call back on Tuesday. Finally got him on phone, asked why tests not on script, he cont. to argue that would show symptoms. Then said would have to come in and pay another copay to get those tests added then hung up on me. He is clearly strapped for cash, and received his doctorate from the University of Phoenix online. Will be making the switch to another doctor,and advising my brother and dad to do same.",1.75

43,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have been a patient of Dr. Felstead's since 1998.  90% of the time I see him directly, even when I am sick. If I have a medical issue or am sick and I need to be seen that day, the staff always finds space for me. With the second office, many times I see Dr. Felstead. I can not stress enough what an excellent doctor he is.  Not once did I feel rushed or that he didn't care about my problems or me as a person. I have read all the other comments that people wrote. He believes in God. I think that helps him as a physician and if he suggests you might need Jesus in your life, that is part of Dr. Felstead's healing process for you. He uses every tool that has been given him to help heal his patients. This man is the best Dr. I have ever been too. I am 61 years old. Thank you, Doc. For all your help getting and keeping me healthy.  ( and no, you can not have my blood lol).",4.75
44,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Love Dr Felstead so hard to see him. He needs new office staff manager. Rude inefficient give wrong dates. Had papers from last visit with date  they put wrong date in computer. Made me come back 2 weeks later. As much as I hate the thought. I am looking for new Dr he's to stretched. . Been a patient since 1997 sad state of affairs. When you can never see your Dr. ,3.00

46,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Staff needs work.  Doctor was professional and helpful.,3.75
47,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Rude. Doesn't look at you when he talks. Spends most of his time typing into the laptop he brings in the office. makes you wonder if he is really listening to what you are saying. However the Staff at the office is nice.,2.75
48,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Rude staff never can see dr Felstead  takes a month to get an apt why have a doctor,2.00
49,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have no issues with Dr Felstead himself. But his office staff is HORRIBLE. Rude, mess up appointment times and to somehow your fault, and good luck making an appointment! They have too many patients and inept staff. He should abandon ship and start over somewhere new. But for now, after being a patient of his for over 10 years and unable to make a sick appointment AGAIN, I find myself at immediate care. What is the point of having a primary you can't even get in to see?",2.00
50,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"My father started seeing doctor Felstead when he first started out at dent tower (I believe).  I have been seeing him now for roughly 13 years now and i am male 23 years of age.  I cannot stress how good of a man this guy is, he will always listen and work with you if your willing to try.  He has concerns about my health as if he was a family member.  I feel like i have a personal yet professional relationship with him which means alot to me.  He is a strong believer in Jesus Christ and i haven't necessarily found my faith yet but he will discuss this matter with me as well if i bring it up.  Overall he cares, you can tell it just by his presence.  However they have grown from one building to 3 locations making in my opinion primary care the best doctors offices i have ever visited.  The nurses 9 out of 10 times are very friendly and knowledgeable.  With growth comes demand and issues like things falling through the cracks.  Still, he remains the best doctor i have ever had.",5.00
51,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Dr. Felstead is awesome! The practice is Christian based as are many doctors of Osteopathy (DO). Staff is overstressed, so don't call on Tuesdays or Thursdays, but I still highly recommend him. He's fairly laid back though so if you have a serious ongoing problem you have to really emphasize what is bothering you and ask lots of questions. He gives as much time as you need. The nurse practitioners are good too, but Dr. Felstead is the best, I've seen him for years. Its rare to find a good family doctor in WNY these days. Worth the wait! :-)",3.00
52,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I really. Liked Dr Felstead..wish I could still see him...his staff was always very rude..and since second office opened too many problems ..they caused severe stress and raised my blood pressure on phone,1.00

55,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I had  been going to Dr. Felstead for years, had a chronic illness that he pretty much chalked up to stress.   Spent four years on and off drugs for different things.  Got fed up with the office switch""We can't put you in with your regular Doctor, can you see an intern?...""  and went to someone else.  In one office visit and blood work, had it daignosed and treated.   I waited for that for four years.   Way to long......",2.75
56,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have treated with Dr. Felstead for more than a decade and always found him to be the consummate professional. He is a very concerned and caring physician, runs a tight ship, and always there. He will return a phone call, never rush you out of an office visit, and follows up consistently and thoroughly. Definitely the man! I highly recommend him and the practice as a whole (where my entire family goes).",5.00
57,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I went to Dr. Felstead after having my first baby, was having extreme depression and anxiety. I told Dr. Felstead of all my issues, including insomnia, panic attacks, fear of death..ect. Dr. Felstead told me that I needed to have a relationship with God and all my fears would go away. He even gave me the address to his wife's group that get together at there church to talk about children. I was very angry and disappointed that a ""DR"" would give me religious advise and send me on my way. I'm thankful I saw another Dr. soon after who listened to me and prescibed a medication. He needs to keep medicine and Religion seperate. I'm lucky I'm healthy and my child is too.",2.00
58,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"my entire family goes to dr felstead, he's been my primary care physician for a long time, he's a great doctor, friendly, caring, listens and never makes you feel like he's rushing to get to the next patient. keep up the good work.",4.75

63,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I was the patient of Dr.Ingrid Arnold for 20 years. I moved out of states and was nervous about choosing a new doctor. I couldnt ask for a better doctor than Dr.Felstead!,5.00

65,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Horrible experience with this office.   IF you can get an appointment with Dr. K. he's great, but good luck. I 've been blown off several times for something I feel is serious. Can never get an appointment and when you can finally get through to make an appointment, they try to pass you off to a physicians assistant or give you a phone number for a specialist instead of actually trying to see you.   Absolutely unacceptable.

66,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"My treatment by Dr K has been wonderful; his staff very kind. I recommend him highly. Knowledgeable, confident, caring, kind, compassionate. Using the patient portal has gotten prompt responses and help from the kind staff. ",4.50

68,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Dr. Karaszewski is a very good doctor, but his office staff is absolutely incompetent.  A history of non-returned calls (or multiple calls to do what should have taken one call) and billing mistakes have me looking elsewhere.  ",2.75

75,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,He was very knowledgeable.Asked many questions to get a well rounded feel for what was wrong. I'm glad my wife and I go to him. Staff seems very quick to refer you to an emergency room or an immediate care facility versus getting you in the office within the week. Lets end on a positive note. He has a great memory and I feel well taken care of when I leave.,4.00
76,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Is not punctual in getting test results back to patient. Does not remind patients to get required blood test for cholesterol every 4-6 months...even though patient had painful indications in hips/legs. Unnecessary tests taken when cholesterol medication change was apparently needed - problem corrected. Patient brought the question to the doctor regarding medication change.,3.25
77,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have been a patient of Dr. Liu-Chen‚Äôs for over 10 years. I have family members who are patients of hers as well. I was surprised to read some of the criticisms below.  She is obviously busy but has never been ‚Äúpushy‚Äù and spends as much time as one needs. She is highly intelligent, her knowledge is current and she is an excellent diagnostician. While she does speak rapidly with a mild accent, she is fluid in the English language and I have never had a problem understanding her.  In addition, and just as importantly, she is caring and compassionate. I have also emailed her on occasion and have always had a timely response.  As an RN with over 35 years of experience with many physicians and health care providers, Dr. Liu-Chen is one of the best.",4.75

80,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"So pushy she wants everything to be done the way she likes. When your insurance is not accepted by the referral doctor she get annoyed and has the nerve to tell you that you make her do more paper work. She loves to talk off topic a lot that she invade your  personal life than focusing on medical issues.  When she speaks her medical plan you feel that she opened her brain manual and mark check in everything  without listening to you.  I believed she is a great doctor and I had to stuck with her because I couldn't find another primary care within 2 months. Also, She a really bad listener that I rather see her physician assistant Carolyne who helped me figure things out. ",3.00
81,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Met with her as a new patient. She was not respectful to the fact that my ""personal"" life is the result of choice and not a chemical imbalance. Focused so much on that topic that ultimately, the appointment (a routine physical) became emotionally invasive rather than medically helpful. Unfortunate because I want to believe she is a good doctor and maybe is for other people, but my experience was uncomfortable and made me doubtful that my health is at the forefront of her mind.

88,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I had some X-rays done recently from a Hospital. The doctor never once discussed in person or called me, to let me know what my x-ray results were.  I'm not sure about others, but I like to be kept informed about all of my results - good or bad.  I thought a doctor and patient is suppose to have open and an excellent communication.  I can't remember everything as for reminding the doctor during my routine check up, their the one's with my chart right in front of them.  That's why I'm listing this score, so others will know if they really want to have this physican as their doctor.  Good luck with your physican hunt.",2.25

90,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"This doctor is outstanding.  He has never treated me or my family with anything other than the utmost respect.  He is very caring and approaches his patient care as an old time doctor would - like a member of the family or smaller community.  He is extremely knowledgeable.  There hasn't been a question he hasn't been able to answer in detail.  I check his answers afterward!  He takes my questions and concerns seriously and works on a care plan WITH me and not just FOR me.  If he moves out of the area, I will have to move too.",5.00

100,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have to admit, I did not have good results with Dr B for a good year or so. It was when I was about ready to switch primary's that she kicked in full throttle. She had her own great opinions about my health and even questioned other Drs. She lead me to great referrals who have changed my life. The staff is really not the problem, either. I just have not had a great experience w/ her NP, but all in all, she has helped me as well. Give Dr B and staff a chance!!",4.75
101,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I, disagree with all the comments regarding the Doctor or the staff.  Each and every time, I've ever had an appt. they have all been helpful and kind.  We are not talking about the same Doctor or Staff.  I always, recommend this Doctor and Staff.",5.00
102,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I have been a patient of Dr. Baldassari for over five years now and initialli, i too, was put off by the reception/ front end staff. Must admit that they have improved greatly over the past year and a half.  The Doctor herself I have found to be knowledgeable and all too willing to listen & advise. Never have i felt rushed in the examining room, nor felt to be treated in a condescending manner. Even though i have moved further from the office, i still will continue to have her as my primary MD.",3.75
103,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I also went to Dr. Baldassari for years and endured the long waits, the indifferent and ever-changing staff and caustic and condescending attitude of the doctor herself.  Forget about thorough exams here.  Expect to be pushed off to a specialist for anything but the most minor complaints.  When I requested my medical records be sent to my new physician, nobody even asked why.",1.00
104,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Dr. Baldassari is a good listener and does not rush through your visit. She addresses any problems and is helpful in finding a specialist if needed. When I have called for emergency visits, I have been able to see the doctor the same, or the next day without a problem.",4.50
105,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I went to Dr. Baldassari for years.  Her office staff has always been rude but I overlooked it as I liked her until I got very sick.  She didn't even seem to know what was wrong with me.  If fact, it was my eye doctor who I ended up going to, who knew exactly what I had.  She seemed more concerned about going on her vacation at the time than my care.  I have since found another Doctor and have not regreted switching for one second.  In fact she probably doesn't even know I haven't been back.",1.50
106,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Service is not a priority here at all. I will let all other post speak for me. Left her service and will NEVER go back. ABSOLUTE WORST!!,1.00
107,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I too was a patient of Dr Baldassari. She is without a doubt the most abrasive and lack of caring physician I have ever been to. You feel as if you are paying her to make you sicker. Her staff is rude and crude and I feel that she must know that this is going on and does not care one bit. That says a lot for her. She also goes through PA's and NP's like most go through underweat.If you want to continue being sick, she is all you need. Glad that I switched!",1.00
108,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I changed from her service years ago.  Her staff is rude and you feel as though you are bothering them to come in .  The doctor is very harsh and also makes you feel worse than when you went in.  She would do much better if she got rid of her staff.,1.75
109,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Dr. Baldassari needs to cut back on the number of patients she has. Her practice has become to big. On the rare ocassion I need an apointment the same day - I am always seen but made to feel that ""this is not your day to be a patient."". In fact, two different times a staffer has said ""We're really to busy for this today."" The last time, the doctor herself said it to me! I will be changing doctors.",3.50
110,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Despite believing her to be abrasive, I have been confident with Dr. Baldassari as my primary care physician.  However, after my wife saw her for the first time my attitude changed. Her family history was demoralized and she was spoken to with complete disregard for the fact that she was a human-being.  Also, the entire staff is notorious for making you feel as though you're an utter inconvenience... and my wife's experience has more than confirmed this notion.",2.25
111,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Dr. Baldassari is very thorough (with hearing testing and ekg)and I have also found that she is very easy to talk to and very direct. Dr. Baldassari explains things in a way I understand and always tell me what is being done.,4.25
112,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"This office seems to suffer from a bad case of ""indifference"" or apathy to their obvious mission. The wait times are awful; the staff seems harried and stressed. In my experience I have seen numerous staff changes, and I finally decided to shop elsewhere. I witnessed Med Sales persons arrive and get in to see Doctor immediately, while I wait another 45 minutes to get to wait another 15 in an exam room. All toll the average 15 minutes appointment requires an hour wait time pass the scheduled appointment time. The entire office seems cold and aloof, and not interested in my thoughts about my treatments. A few times a long standing appointment would be changed with a few days notice. Getting her on the phone to straighten out an RX problem took 2 days.",2.00
113,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,This lady and her staff especially are not very helpful. They blow you off and don't seem to care about your problems. The wait is at least an hour in the waiting room alone. The office staff is not the greatest and everytime I've called they always make me call back in an hour or more.,3.00

He takes his time with everyone, which is why I gave him a ""4"" instead of a ""5"" for ""punctuality"" He does not rush you, he asks questions, and he answers questions, and he had always made it a point to try and see me if I am there, even as a walk-in.

I have been with him for over 15 years now and do not plan to leave. I would recommend him to all.",3.75
120,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,One of the most unprofessional doctors I have ever encountered.  Arrogant and rude.  I am leaving the practice and one of the reasons is this man.  He should find another profession,1.00
121,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I m VERY unhappy with this doctor. He has not cared about my family or myself at all. He doesn't seem as if he listens to your concerns. I am looking for a new doctor ASAP. I would NOT recommend him at all.,2.50
122,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"This doctor is way too relaxed and somewhat unprofessional and actually acts bored as he sits at his desk and listens (at least I think he was listening) to you talk.  Doesn't register any emotion and seems way to ""chill"" so I don't feel like I can trust what he says.  Maybe at a coffee shop his behavior would be seen as cool, but as a doctor I have doubts.  I am now on this site looking for a new doc but wanted to warn others!!",2.75
123,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"We were not happy with Dr. Trock.  Seemed indifferent to our concerns, just went through the motions of a doctor visit.  Little to no eye contact or personable demeanor.  Also very closed minded when asked about other treatment possibilities.  Also long waits in waiting room past appointment time. We've left this practice.  I do not recommend.",2.50
124,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,Dr. Trock is a thorough physician.  He listens and then explains what it is and what can be done.  He watches medications and changes accordingly.  He is my primary physician and I am completely satisfied.,4.75
125,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Glad to say i've found a much better dr. Stay away from this one. Completely disregarded some of my concerns,didn't seem like he knew what he was taling about, and sat there and stared at his laptop the whole time during my visits. Rude! This dr. is the reason why i felt the need to even go on a site like this. Horrible! Two thumbs down.",2.25
126,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Although quiet at times ,he is always available to me. Nursing and Reception Staff excellent. Nursing Supervisor Diane is always available to answer my questions she is an asset to the practice.Good to know that he has excellent staff.",4.50

128,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,By far the worst Dr. I have ever had the misfortune of having care for me. He and his gang of arrogant Dr's from his group should not be in this business,1.00
129,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Extremely unprofessional, inconsiderate, and inefficient.  Disregarded questions.

""Id like to make an appt to see Dr. Mendonza"" ""Well, whats wrong with you?"". Twice they have told me an appointment time, ie, 12:30, when the doctor has thought my appt. was at 12:00 or 11:30... twice. NOT MY MISTAKE. Then I was scolded by the doctor... (?? I felt like I was in HS and being scolded for being late to class?? rude and inappropriate?)  So yes, shes punctual. And very into punctuality.. .. When discussing concerns she constantly nods her head and says ""mmhmm,"" or ""ok, ok, ok,"" and I just feel HURRIED.... I wonder if she can hear 50% of what im saying over all of her rude ""mmhmm""ing, which just makes me feel like shes not listening",3.00

In a rare instance when follow up or research was required, she called me at home in the evening to deliver results and or information. Gives you copies of blood work, test results etc. explains the results and anything out of normal ranges that may require follow up. She consults her records and asks questions about previous visit issues. She is insightful and offers advise on preventative measures to avoid future potential health problems. She has a great attitude and is a refreshing addition to the medical profession.",4.50

143,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I had gone to Dr. Meaney Elman for several years. Previous visits were fine, having few health issues. However, my last visit was a determining factor in my decision never to return.  I had waited over 2 mos to see her so that I could discuss a problem. I was fine with the wait, I am a patient person. However, I was hopeful that she would listen, be supportive. and possibly refer me to a specialist who may be able to  help.  My appointment was the last of the day and it was very obvious that Dr. Meaney was stressed and wanted to get out of there. She would not let me finish a sentence . As I tried to discuss the problem, she kept stating that she doesn't treat it. I kept trying to tell her that I realize she wouldn't treat it but I was hoping for some advice on who may be able to help me.  She did not hear me out and her response was very inappropriate. She used the analogy that it would be like her coming to me (I am not an MD) and asking me to treat her _______. (I will leave that blank as I don't want any rumors started that she has a medical condition, I believe she was just using it as an example)  The analogy, however,  was very off.  A friend of mine went to her for something she contracted at work and her response was the same ""I don't treat that"".  I was under the assumption that you could discuss any  health care issue with your primary.   I have since found another primary and he had no problem with me discussing the problem that I had tried to discuss with Dr. Meaney.  He was professional and I feel fortunate that he was accepting new patients.  I agree with the last writer.  Dr. Meaney acts very unprofessional when she is feeling stressed.  I advise anyone who goes to her or is considering going to her, make sure that you are not her last appointment of the day.  You may perhaps get a better result if you catch her earlier in the day.

She is a nice doctor, fairly thorough & knowledgeable, but very unprofessional (telling me how stressed she is, etc.), unheard of wait times to see her (1-2 hours+) and her staff is the worst - rude and totally unprofessional.  After i told Dr. Elman my feelings she said her staff would be shocked to hear this.  Maybe she better have patient surveys completed and she would realize what is going on in her office.  Needless to say i left & now receive very professional care elsewhere.",2.25
145,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Some wait occasionally but VERY worth the wait. She is very personable, helpful, knowledgeable, does not leave a stone unturned.  She is the most caring doctor I have ever experienced, simply the best",4.75

147,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I love Dr. Elman but after 4 years my blood pressure is still off the charts.  Patient files are a mess.  I had to wait 20 min. for them to find test results from 3 months ago.  They hadn't even been filed.  It is not unheard of to wait over 2 hours for her and then you get her only if you're lucky.  Her PA is very nice but I didn't come to her to see a PA.  I guess I'm tired of ""nice"" and am moving on.",2.00
148,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"This dr. offered nothing and was negative and punitive when my dad asked for additional bloodwork to help sort out a medical problem. After waiting 2 hours to see her, that was the last straw.",2.25

154,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I think it is interesting that the helpful comments have never had an issue they needed to discuss with her. I have been with her for about 5 years and when I was healthy, I always found her to be very friendly. When I came to her with a stomach issue, she was very unhelpful and prefers to refer out to anyone else. I also told her that I was starting to take on a few natural approaches to my health and she could not have rolled her eyes further back in her head. She was unable to contain her distain and instead of working with me, continued to  give me reasons why it wouldn't work. Although I believe that what is best is usually a mixture of modern and natural medicines, she clearly was not willing to work with other professionals. She tried to reel it in at the end of the visit, but the damage was already done when she showed her true colors.",2.75
155,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I asked to be tested for STDs and she told me to go to my OB/GYN for that.  Why couldn't she order simple blood work?  Appears it's easier to go to a free testing clinic than deal with your PCP.,2.00
156,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Dr. Nicole L. Symons, should not be a patient seeing physician.  I feel for her staff, for any mishap is blamed on them.  Dr. Nicole L. Symons did not listen during the appointment, she lost her temper more then once and spoke abruptly over my loved ones concerns.  Upsetting and disturbing to have been a witness to such demeaning behavior by a Doctor.  When your sick or in pain, severe pain; a bit more time is needed to express concerns, Dr. Nicole L. Symons could not afford the time and displayed little compassion for the undue stress she was putting on the patient with her awful disposition.  Furthermore, Dr. Nicole L. Simons did not inform us she was ending the appointment (due to the 15 minutes was up) and left onto another patient, again leaving her staff to explain.  I urge those who read this do not consider Dr. Nicole L. Simons for your care; and if you have a loved ones whom see her for care please do not leave them alone with Dr. Nicole L.

158,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I am very displeased with this office.  Very poor communication and no follow up.  Dr. Symons always gives me the impression she is not listening and just going through the motions.  I have no confidence in her diagnostics skills.  but I have been with the Buffalo Medical Group for over 40 years but I will be looking for a new primary doctor.  ,1.50
159,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I agree with all the other comments.  She shows little emotion and has a poor attitude for a doctor.  Refers you to other doctors for every little thing.  I don't think she wants any responsibility at all.    Would not recommend her.

160,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I found Dr, Symon's to be very clinical, vague and difficult with which to deal. Forget about reaching her in an emergency or discussing lab results.  Not the quality usually found with Buffalo Medical Group.",1.00
161,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"Any time I have gone to see her, she will not commit to any diagnosis. She refers me to specialists, all within their circle of doctors. I scratched my eye and she referred me to an eye doctor. I had a white pimple on the inside of my throat for many weeks, it hurt but tested negative for strep so she referred me to a throat specialist. I had pink eye and was told there was nothing I can do but wait it out. 
I agree that she sits there, patiently listening, but I have to wonder if she  hears what is being said. Blank stare, emotionless. Thankfully I am relatively healthy and I have not been back. Very disappointed with their whole practice. I'm currently looking for another doctor, one that appears to have an interest in their patients.",1.50
162,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,I am leaving Symons practice because there is a lack of care for the patient and a lack of urgency! I went to her on a Wednesday at 8:15am because I had symptoms of Strep. She took a throat culture and said it might not be until Friday before I get the results. I called later in the day on Wednesday because I was feeling worse and asked if she'd consider giving me an antibiotic but she said no because she felt the chances of Strep were low. I woke up on Thursday with white spots on the back of my throat and called again giving the office this info and again was told I have to wait. Meanwhile I'm taking Advil for the pain and using salt water per her advice. Friday morning I call and no results. Symons has her assistant tell me that as soon as the results are in she will call me (basically telling me to stop calling) and I said that I didn't want to go into the weekend without some type of treatment. I decided to go to immediate care. They did a rapid strep test which came back positive for Strep and put me on an antibiotic immediately. I had it for 3 days and missed work all because Symons didn't seem to know what she was doing or even cared to make an effort.,1.25
163,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I would have to agree that she has an attitude and poor people skills, although I would be willing to overlook that if she were a good Dr. I too tried to switch to another doctor within the group because the location is good, but I was told I was unable to. Apparently Dr. Symons did not find out that I asked because she still sees me, although I am currently trying to replace her.",2.25
164,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"I gave Dr. Symons a chance.  Have been going to her for about 6 years. She functions as a robot.  She shows no emotion and doesn't look outside the box. If at 50 you are suppose to have certain tests, that's all she orders.  You could have complaints or ask for something additional and she doesn't order it. But the best and shame on Buffalo Medical Group is that I wanted to switch to another MD in the group and they said no and the when she found out, she discharged me from her practice. Frankly I fired her first but who has ever heard of a practice that doesn't get you a patient advocate and help you find a doctor that you can work well with. I have found another PCP and won't look back at BMG.  Also, check out her credentials, she went to a sub standard medical school.",2.00

168,Dr. Bertrand P. Roche,Family Doctor / G.P.,4.52,7,"This doctor was rude, and did not listen to me. I went in for significant pain, and unable to see my doctor, saw her instead. She had an attitude with me, as if the fact that the whole area was painful was MY FAULT. When I showed here where it hurt the most, she just shrugged at me. I have some more potent pain meds for another problem, and I'd been taking them two at a time, because the pain I was having was so significant that those meds, and over the counter ones all together, were just not helping. I had to literally beg her, crying, for help. And even then she grudgingly gave me a script for meds that were a small step above what I'd been taking before, with a comment about how few she was giving me, in a seriously nasty tone. I hope some day she is in massive pain, and a doctor just looks at her and shrugs.",3.25
