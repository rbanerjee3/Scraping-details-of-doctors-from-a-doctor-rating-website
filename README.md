Title: Web-Scraping Details of Doctors available on Doctor Rating Website called RateMDs.

Motivation: 

After I decided to become a data-scientist, the first common question that every other data-science aspirant like me asks is what should I start with? Some of the popular answers are: build your concepts in statistics, learn Python, learn machine learning, etc. So, after spending 3 months brushing my statistics and learning Python, I was ready for my next task i.e learning Machine Learning. Meanwhile, I also used to read 2-3 articles every day and one fine day, I came across this article: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/11/get-hired-as-data-scientist.html. What attracted me the most in that post was the last point:

"Do things that seem crazy. Everyone goes to the UCI repository, or uses some stock dataset (yawn) to build their project. Don’t do that. Learn how to use a web scraping library, or some under-appreciated API to build your own, custom dataset. Data is hard to come by, and companies often need to rely on their engineers to get it for them. Your goal should be to come across as the kind of data science-obsessed lunatic who will build your own goddamn dataset if that’s what it takes to get the job done."

And I agreed so much with that statement. If you don't have the required data what's the use of all the Statistics and Machine Learning you have learnt. Luckily, I got a chance to work under my professor at Graduate School on a Data-Analytics Project and my first task was to scrape data from a Doctor Rating Website in the US.

Overview:

This code would help you scrape data for all the doctors(type of specialty should be provided by the user) in a particular city.
The details of Doctor includes:
a. Name of the Doctor
b. Specialty
c. Star-Rating
d. No. of Reviews
